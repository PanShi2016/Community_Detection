# This file contains the links of a word association graph obtained from the  #
# South Florida Free Association norms list available at                      #

# In the original data the weight of a directed link from one word to another #
# indicates the frequency that the people in the survey associated the end    #
# point of the link with its start point. Since the clique percolation method #
# (CPM) built in CFinder deals with undirected networks, these directed links #
# have been replaced by undirected ones with a weight equal to the sum of the #
# weights of the corresponding two original links. Furthermore, a weight      #
# threshold of w=0.025 was applied to the resulting network by deleting links #
# weaker than w. The remaining 31784 links between 7207 nodes are listed be-  #
# low.                                                                        #
