This directory contains a subset of the data containing terrorism related information collected by the MIND Lab at UMD (http://www.mindswap.org/).

This subset of the dataset was designed for classifying the type of relationship connecting two terrorists and contains two types of information: the attributes of the relations and the links that connect various relations together to form a graph structure. Note that the same relationship entity can be assigned multiple labels which means that the the user may want to use this dataset for multi-label classification experiments. Please take a look at our paper (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sen/pubs/sna2006/RelClzPIT.pdf) for more information about the experiment setup.

Below we give some more information about the files in this directory:
* TerroristRel.labels: Contains the class labels to be assigned to each relationship.
* TerroristRel_Colleague: Contains all the relationship entities assigned the label "colleague". Each line begins with a unique id for the entity, followed by a 0-1 vector of attribute values and finally, the class label. If the class label of the entity says "non-colleague" then this particular relationship is not an instance of the "colleague" relationship.
* TerroristRel_Congregate: Contains all the relationship entities assigned the label "congregate". Each line begins with a unique id for the entity, followed by a 0-1 vector of attribute values and finally, the class label. If the class label of the entity says "non-congregate" then this particular relationship is not an instance of the "congregate" relationship.
* TerroristRel_Contact: Contains all the relationship entities assigned the label "contact". Each line begins with a unique id for the entity, followed by a 0-1 vector of attribute values and finally, the class label. If the class label of the entity says "non-contact" then this particular relationship is not an instance of the "contact" relationship.
* TerroristRel_Family: Contains all the relationship entities assigned the label "family". Each line begins with a unique id for the entity, followed by a 0-1 vector of attribute values and finally, the class label. If the class label of the entity says "non-family" then this particular relationship is not an instance of the "family" relationship.
* TerroristRel.edges: Each line contains two ids of terrorist relationships. This file defines the edges connecting the relationships in this dataset. We ask the reader to take a look at our paper (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sen/pubs/sna2006/RelClzPIT.pdf) for more details about how we defined the edges.
